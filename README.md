Just walked out of The Life List and I swear my back has fused with the chair, still finding popcorn crumbs in my hoodie pocket. What even was that? A fever dream or a revelation, not sure. It’s like they poured 3 shots of tequila into a kale smoothie—barely a plot but mesmerizing in its chaos. The theater was buzzing like a wasp hive mid-summer, and I missed half the dialogue every time someone rustled their candy wrappers, the eternal curse of snacks in cinemas.

> I swear, the lead actress’s eyes were like two searchlights, cutting through all the fog, and her monologue about...uh, life’s fleeting nature? might have been about toast. Hard to tell. Her voice—𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed like a vinyl record that’s been left too long in the sun—but man, it carried. 

Remember when that guy showed up from nowhere, dressed in what looked like a patchwork quilt made by a colorblind GPS? Unwrapped a burrito with more grace than I’ve seen most people solve life crises. Oh, and the dog! They’ve nailed the dog. Like a fluffy oracle answering questions nobody asked.

I think someone whispered about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   in that surreal rooftop scene where time stood still—right before the dolphin appeared... or was I imagining it? Either way, a miniature flash of reality in the blender.

The sound was like standing inside an industrial fan, feels like your bones are buzzing long after the lights come back on. Those final frames though, so jarring that even my drink toppled over from its cupholder—like the storyline, it should’ve worn a seatbelt.

The lighting—stellar, but at times I thought I was seeing glimpses of what the insides of a toaster would look like if toasters had visions of grandeur. Makes me want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to see if any of it becomes even remotely logical outside this bubble of bewilderment.
